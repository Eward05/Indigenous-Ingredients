<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">This blog is dedicated to showcasing the culture, heritage and traditions of the Indigenous ingredients often taken for granted by most Canadians.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">Indigenous Cuisine</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">Indigenous Cuisine is cooking that is rich with tradition and history. It not only tells the stories of the past using local, seasonal ingredients inspired by the lands and oceans but it also emphasizes the fact that people can live in balance with their surroundings and respect all forms of life. More specifically, Indigenous ingredients and cooking draws a greater awareness to no-waste, head-to-tail cooking, something that most Canadians aren&#39;t familiar with and therefore provides them with a new perspective of our country&#39;s origins.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">Indigenous Food Culture</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">In most culures around the world, food traditions are passed down from generation to generation, but the Indigenous people of Canada were stripped of that opportunity with white-washing via government-funded and church-run residential schools, ultimately erasing their cultural traditions and ceremonies. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing focus in the role that Indigenous food systems play in providing food security, while enhancing biodiversity across the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><em>Food for us comes from our relatives, whether they have wings or fins or roots. That is how we consider food. Food has a culture. It has a history. It has a story. It has relationships</em>&nbsp;- <strong>Winona LaDuke</strong></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><u>Wild Rice</u>: As a staple food source for the Ojibwa people and other Nations, wild rice served as an essential source of nutrients because it is rich in flavor and high in nutrition. Not only is wild rice a native cereal but it is also the only native grain to Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><u>Animals</u>: Hunting animals such as deer, elk, moose, caribou, antelope, seal, whale, walrus and polar bear all offer a wonderful opportunity to teach young children and youth about living on the land, life skills, saftey and responsibility. It not only fosters a sense of self, pride and respect for our natural enviornment, promotes culture and tradition but the meat is also higher in dietary cholesterol and less calories than domestic meats making it a healthier choice. In addition every part of the animal was consumed or used to make clothing or shelter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><u>Blueberries</u>:&nbsp;Blueberrys are native to North America and Canada, growing throughout the woods and mountain regions. Indigenous people had many uses for blueberries beyond being an excellent food source. They were used for their medical properties and the act of blueberry picking provided an opportunity for socialization, story-telling and teaching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><u>Fiddleheads</u>:&nbsp;Fiddlehead Greens are the premium wild forage vegetable of Spring providing a good source of vitamins A and C. Many Indigenous families on the East coast would make an outing of fiddlehead picking, while also teaching there young children how to recognize them.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>1 - Pound fiddleheads</li>
	<li>1 or 2 Garlic cloves, minced very fine</li>
	<li>1/4 cup Butter or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>2 tbsp Finely chopped fresh parsley&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Trim and wash fiddle heads in cold water, removing the brown covering as you go. Drain and pat dry. Heat half of the butter (or olive oil) in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the fern&nbsp;shoots and turn the heat up to medium-high. The ferns should sizzle, but don&#39;t allow the butter to burn. Toss and stir for about 5 minutes. Add the other half of the butter (or oil), the garlic, and the parsley. Continue cooking for one minute longer, or until you can smell the garlic and the ferns are tender. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately on hot plates!&nbsp;</p> <style>
